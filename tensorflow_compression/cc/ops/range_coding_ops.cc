Using the provided cumulative distribution functions (CDF) inside `cdf`, returns
a range-code of `data`.

The shape of `cdf` should have one more axis than the shape of `data`, and the
prefix `cdf.shape[:-1]` should be broadcastable to `data.shape`. That is, for
every `i = 0,...,rank(data) - 1`, the op requires that either
`cdf.shape[i] == 1` or `cdf.shape[i] == data.shape[i]`. Note that this
broadcasting is limited in the sense that the number of axes must match, and
broadcasts only `cdf` but not `data`.

`data` should have an upper bound `m > 0` such that each element is an integer
in range `[0, m)`. Then the last dimension size of `cdf` must be `m + 1`. For
each element of `data`, the innermost strip of `cdf` is a vector representing a
CDF. For each k = 0,...,m, `cdf[..., k] / 2^precision` is the probability that
an outcome is less than `k` (not less than or equal to).

```
   cdf[..., 0] / 2^precision = Pr(data[...] < 0)
   cdf[..., 1] / 2^precision = Pr(data[...] < 1) = Pr(data[...] <= 0)
   cdf[..., 2] / 2^precision = Pr(data[...] < 2) = Pr(data[...] <= 1)
   ...
   cdf[..., m] / 2^precision = Pr(data[...] < m) = 1
```

Therefore each element of `cdf` must be in `[0, 2^precision]`.

Ideally `cdf[..., m]` should equal to `2^precision` but this is not a hard
requirement as long as `cdf[..., m] <= 2^precision`.

The encoded string neither contains the shape information of the encoded data
nor a termination symbol. Therefore the shape of the encoded data must be
explicitly provided to the decoder.

Implementation notes:

- Because of potential performance issues, the op does not check whether
elements of `data` is in the correct range `[0, m)`, or if `cdf` satisfies
monotonic increase property.

- For the range coder to decode the encoded string correctly, the decoder should
be able to reproduce the internal states of the encoder precisely. Otherwise,
the decoding would fail and once an error occur, all subsequent decoded values
are incorrect. For this reason, the range coder uses integer arithmetics and
avoids using any floating point operations internally, and `cdf` should contain
integers representing quantized probability mass rather than floating points.

Range encodes unbounded integer `data` using an indexed probability table.

For each value in `data`, the corresponding value in `index` determines which
probability model in `cdf` is used to encode it. The data can be arbitrary
signed integers, where the integer intervals determined by `offset` and
`cdf_size` are modeled using the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) in
`cdf`. Everything else is encoded with a variable length code.

The argument `cdf` is a 2-D tensor and its each row contains a CDF. The argument
`cdf_size` is a 1-D tensor, and its length should be the same as the number of
rows of `cdf`. The values in `cdf_size` denotes the length of CDF vector in the
corresponding row of `cdf`.

For i = 0,1,..., let `m = cdf_size[i]`. Then for j = 0,1,...,m-1,

```
   cdf[..., 0] / 2^precision = Pr(X < 0) = 0
   cdf[..., 1] / 2^precision = Pr(X < 1) = Pr(X <= 0)
   cdf[..., 2] / 2^precision = Pr(X < 2) = Pr(X <= 1)
   ...
   cdf[..., m-1] / 2^precision = Pr(X < m-1) = Pr(X <= m-2).
```

We require that `1 < m <= cdf.shape[1]` and that all elements of `cdf` be in the
closed interval `[0, 2^precision]`.

Arguments `data` and `index` should have the same shape. `data` contains the
values to be encoded. `index` denotes which row in `cdf` should be used to
encode the corresponding value in `data`, and which element in `offset`
determines the integer interval the cdf applies to. Naturally, the elements of
`index` should be in the half-open interval `[0, cdf.shape[0])`.

When a value from `data` is in the interval `[offset[i], offset[i] + m - 2)`,
then the value is range encoded using the CDF values. The last entry in each
CDF (the one at `m - 1`) is an overflow code. When a value from `data` is
outside of the given interval, the overflow value is encoded, followed by a
variable-length encoding of the actual data value.

The encoded output contains neither the shape information of the encoded data
nor a termination symbol. Therefore the shape of the encoded data must be
explicitly provided to the decoder.

- Because of potential performance issues, the op does not check if `cdf`
satisfies monotonic increase property.

Converts PMF to quantized CDF. This op uses floating-point operations
internally. Therefore the quantized output may not be consistent across multiple
platforms. For entropy encoders and decoders to have the same quantized CDF on
different platforms, the quantized CDF should be produced once and saved, then
the saved quantized CDF should be used everywhere.

After quantization, if PMF does not sum to 2^precision, then some values of PMF
are increased or decreased to adjust the sum to equal to 2^precision.

Note that the input PMF is pre-quantization. The input PMF is not normalized
by this op prior to quantization. Therefore the user is responsible for
normalizing PMF if necessary.
